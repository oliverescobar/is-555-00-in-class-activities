# The mpg dataset is another one of those 'hidden' datasets that is always loaded:
df <- mpg


# Let's do some warmup exercises:
# 
# Create a summary that includes only cars manufactured by "toyota" or "honda", 
# with displ less than 2.0. Show only the manufacturer, model, year, and displ 
# columns in the result, sorted by displ in ascending order.
df %>%
  count(displ)

df %>%
  select(displ) %>%
  summary()

df %>%
  filter(manufacturer %in% c('toyota', 'honda')) %>%
  filter(displ < 2) %>%
  select(manufacturer, model, year, displ) %>%
  arrange()


# Add a new column called efficiency that calculates the average fuel efficiency 
# as (cty + hwy) / 2. Filter the dataset to show only rows where efficiency is 
# greater than 25 and the class is "compact". Display the manufacturer, model, 
# efficiency, and class columns, sorted by efficiency in descending order.


# Group the dataset by class and calculate:
#    - The total number of cars in each class (total_cars).
#    - The average city mileage (avg_cty).
#    - The average highway mileage (avg_hwy).
# Display the results, sorted by total_cars in descending order.
